# Crowdfunding_ETL
 #Summary
In this Project we are building an ETL pipeline by using Python and Pandas in order to export and transform the data. After transforming the data we create CSV files to create an ERD and table schema. After these steps we then upload the results into a Postgress SQL database.

# Process Steps
- Create the Category and Subcategory DataFrames
- Create the Campaign DataFrame
- Create the Contacts DataFrame
- Create the Crowdfunding Database
